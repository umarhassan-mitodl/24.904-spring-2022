  caption: 'At the age of 2 or 3, a child will typically have learned the rules for
    regular plurals, and will apply those rules consistently, for instance by saying
    "gooses" as the plural of *goose*. By the age of 4 or 5, the child is likely to
    have learned common irregular plurals such as *geese*. (Photo courtesy of [Ruth
