In consultation with the instructors, students will choose a particular case study examined in the course and write a 5â€“8 page paper that (i) summarizes the evidence and what it shows or fails to show (especially in light of various theoretical positions) and (ii) makes a concrete proposal about how to follow-up on the existing literature so as to advance our understanding of the phenomenon. The page limit is a rough guide: prioritize clarity and concision. You are encouraged to meet with us early and often to discuss what you are interested in and how to develop your paper.
